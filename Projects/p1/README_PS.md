# TWITTER NETWORK ANALYSIS
The goal of this project is to scrape Twitter data and build a friendship network for the Twitter user "IITARC" 
map and visualize all the user connections in the network as a directed graph, and calculate network parameters such as 
average degree, average weighted degree, directed clustering coefficient, undirected clustering coefficient, weighted network diameter, 
unweighted network diameter, degree centrality, betweenness centrality, close centrality, and page rank.
